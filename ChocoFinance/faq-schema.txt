Chocolate instead invests your money into a portfolio of fixed-income funds designed to optimise risk-adjusted returns based on duration, spread, and currency. This allows the portfolio to target a return of 4.5% p.a. for the first S$20k, and 3.5% p.a. thereafter. 
See your returns daily in the app. What's more, if the portfolio doesn't make the target 4.5% p.a. for your first S$20k, we will top up the difference to ensure you enjoy the target return during the Qualifying Period.

Remember that Chocolate only makes money if you make money, so we are very incentivised to achieve 3.5% target.

Your return is a money-weighted rate of return. We advise that 3.5% p.a. is not guaranteed and there is a potential, although small, for capital losses.

Past performance is not necessarily an indication of future performance."

As you know, we only take a fee (max 2%) once the portfolio has delivered the target (We need to make money somewhere 🤑)...
